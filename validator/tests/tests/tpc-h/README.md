This directory contains positive tests for (some of) the TPC-H queries. For the
most part, they are either completely or partially generated by Isthmus,
however:

 - Aggregations output an extra column according to the spec indicating which
   grouping set was used for a particular row, which the Isthmus plans weren't
   considering.
 - Aggregations with only measures were being emitted by Isthmus as
   aggregations with empty grouping sets rather than no grouping sets.
 - Isthmus was emitting duplicate grouping sets wherever there should only be
   one grouping set.
 - Decimal literals had too many bytes attached to them.
 - Emitted function signatures use `any1` etc. where according to the spec a
   plain `any` should be used.
 - Subqueries are not presently supported by Isthmus, so queries with
   subqueries were merged manually.

NOTE: these queries have not undergone *functional* testing, and have been
manually modified. Therefore, it is quite likely for there to be slight
functional differences between the SQL queries and the plans due to bugs.

TODO: when function resolution is implemented in the validator, the diagnostic
overrides relating to those not currently working should be removed.
